## Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?
    - Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
    - It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic and it does not cause any observable side effects.

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
    - Benifits to pure functions are reading files, random number generation, does not cause any observable side effects, and easier to test.

4. What is immutability?
    - When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created.

5. What is Referential transparency?
    - If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

## What is a module?

1. What does the word ‘require’ do?
    - You can think of the require module as the command and the module module as the organizer of all required modules.

2. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
    - require('./file.name.js')

3. What do we have to do to make a module available?
    - module.export = (function);

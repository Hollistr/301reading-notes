## nosql vs sql

SQL	- Rational database, table based, predifined schema, vertically scaled, structurd query language.

NoSQL- Non-rational database, document based, dynamic schema, horizontally scaled, collection of documents.
 	 
 	 
1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
    - SQL is good for manipulating data.

2. Give a real world example.
    - MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
    - NoSQL is good for hierarchical data.

4. Give a real world example.
    - Hbase is an example for this purpose.

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
    - NoSQL is best for hierarchical data.

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
    - SQL is best for scalability.

1. What does SQL stand for?
    - Structured Query Language

2. What is a relational database?
    - A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
    - logical data structure

4. What is a ‘schema’?
    - A database schema defines how data is organized within a relational database.

5. What is a NoSQL database?
    - NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables.

6. How does it work?
    - 

7. What is inside of a Mongo database?
    - MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
    - While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
    - Disadvantages. NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID). This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability.
